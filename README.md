The webApp will be deployed on Azure and will use Hyperledger Fabric and Composer tools to provide a solution for e-voting and removing the obstacles which include:
-Voting in your district from a distant place.
-Editing the voters list at real-time
-Removing the EVM hacking accusations
-Increase the speed of vote counting

Each user will have his/her vote counted while maintaining the anonymity of the user. We will use the already provided Certificate Authority by the Azure platform.


Each voter and candidate will be a Participant in the network while the ballot and vote will be assests whose value will change when the participant executes a transaction.
